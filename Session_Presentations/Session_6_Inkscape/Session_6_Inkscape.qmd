## What is Vector Graphics?

-   Traditional graphic design software uses raster graphics, made up of pixels.

-   Vector graphics, on the other hand, are based on mathematical paths and can be scaled infinitely without losing quality.

-   This makes them perfect for logos, icons, and **plots** that need to be used in various sizes.

    (People used to print A4 only now we zoom in and out Screen)

## Class activity 1 : Explore a JPEG, PNG and SVG. (10 min) {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Open the Jpeg and PNG (in a browser) Try to zoom in & out.

    -   We could increase resolution but to what level and file size?

-   Open the SVG (in a browser) Try to zoom in & out.

-   Open the SVG in Notepad++ or notepad

    -   (will need to force it to open from software)

-   Ignoring the head what components make up a SVG

## Inkscape vs Adobe Illustrator {.smaller}

Affinity: Anouther alternative with a one time payments model (benefit over free...?)

## Basic Operations to draw

We'll watch a video to cover how to use Inkscape to draw. 13 min

## Typical use in science

-   Whilst it may be useful to replace Powerpoint, paint, publisher or biorendor to draw our utalisation in science more likely focuses on figure compiling.

-   Panel arrangements in R e.g. ggarrange, cowplot. often compromise fine controls

-   Alternative approach is output panels in SVG or PNG and arrange in inkscape

## Class activity 2 : 15 min {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Open Algae_Layout_start

-   Resize the images to 40 mm apart form the 100x magnification

-   Add a square 30\*30 mm and clip to cut crop images to squares of 30x30

-   Using align and distribute to arrange the images in a grid with 5px gaps

-   Add text labels aligning them with the middle of the images with 5mm spacing

-   Group the object and export as a png

The core extensions are:

1.  **Scale Plots**: Changes the size or aspect ratio of a plot without modifying its text and ticks, making it easy to assemble multi-panel figures. Also works on non-plots.

2.  **Homogenizer**: Sets uniform fonts, font sizes, and stroke widths in a selection.

3.  **Flattener**: Eliminates the structure of imported figures, making them easier to edit. For most imports, this should be the first thing you run.

4.  **Autoexporter**: Automatically refreshes exports of SVGs in a folder, while producing exports immune to the rendering bugs of Office and Acrobat.

5.  **Gallery Viewer**: Quickly view and edit all SVGs in a file or folder.

## Class activity 3 : 15 min {.smaller}

-   Open Inkscape_extenstions_example_start.

-   run scale plots on D to make it 1/2 as wide and 1/3 as tall

-   run flattener and homogeniser to fix all text to 7 pt

-   Set all fill and stroke to 0.8 pt

-   use gridlines and the alignment tool align all plots to a gird matching plot areas
